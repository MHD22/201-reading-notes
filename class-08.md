# Read: 08 - More CSS Layout

### _______________________________

## CSS Layout

- `<div>` elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.

- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

- The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

- Grids help create professional and flexible designs. X CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. X You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
