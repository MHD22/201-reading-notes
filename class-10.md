# Read: 10 - JS Debugging

- If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.

- Debugging is the process of finding errors.
- It involves a process of deduction.

- The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.

- JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.

- If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
