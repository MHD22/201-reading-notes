# Read: 03 - HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

#### ________________________

## HTML Lists:


- There are three types of HTML lists: 
   1. ordered.
   2. unordered. 
   3. and definition. `<dl><dt><dd></dd></dt></dl>' 
   *defenition list, definition term, definition.*
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another.

#### ________________________

## CSS Boxes: 

- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding
for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and
visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and
- inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of
boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image
borders and rounded borders.

## JS Control Flow

- Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.
- Comparison operators (`===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>`)
are used to compare two operands.
- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.
- `if ... else` statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is **true**, and another if it is **false**.
- `switch` statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).
- Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
- All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
- There are three types of loop: `for, while, and do ... while` Each repeats a set of statements.
