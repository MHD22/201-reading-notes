# Read: 12 - Docs for the HTML <canvas> Element & Chart.js

## The `<canvas>` element: 

- `<canvas id="tutorial" width="150" height="150"></canvas>`
At first sight a `<canvas>` looks like the `<img>` element, with the only clear difference being that *it doesn't have the src and alt attributes.*

- The `<canvas>` element has only two attributes, width and height.

- These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties.

- When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.

- The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.
